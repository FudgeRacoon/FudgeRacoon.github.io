                    Since the dawn of the first video game, collision has always been a part of any game created.
                    Lots of collision algorithms are out there, some are easy to master and some are not. However, any collision
                    system implemented must have some way to check if the interaction between two objects actually occurs. Checking
                    for collisions between a few objects in a scene is relatively easy. Altough, when it comes to checking for collision
                    between hundreds, or even thousands of objects using the dreaded pairwise comparison, that will take a great toll on
                    performance. Luckily, there exists many collision checks that offer efficiency and speed. One of which is the quad tree
                    data structure.

                    A quad tree is a tree data structure used in spatial partitioning, so that it's easy to traverse
                    and search. You may be wondering what exactly is spatial partitioning? To put it in simple terms,
                    spatial partitioning is the process of subdiving a scene into multiple regions, and that is exactly
                    what a quad tree does. It recursivly subdivids a game's world into smaller and smaller sections.
                    Genrally, a quad tree must fulfill a certain criteria where each non-leaf node must have four children,
                    every leaf node has a maximum number of objects and if that number is exceeded the node is split.
