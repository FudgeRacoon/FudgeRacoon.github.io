                Having objects in a video game or a physics simulation unable to interact with one another means they 
                can go through each other or in other words interpenetrate each other which is not desired in many cases.
                To actually simulate realism of interaction between objects we have to check if they collide with one another
                and if they are we have to resolve this collision, such as applying forces that alter their velocites, so that they
                move in the opposite directions. However, this tutorial will be purely discussing collision checks algorithms with 
                collision resolution discussed in a seperate tutorial.

                <h3>Axis-Aligned Bounding Box</h3>
            </header>

            <p>
                One of the simplest collision checks is the Axis-Aligned bounding box or AABB for short. It works by generating
                an axis aligned (meaning all of it's edges are parallel to both axis the x and y) rectangle around an object and 
                ensures there is no gap between any of the 4 sides of the rectangle aganist another rectangle. If any gap exists 
                then no collision occured.

                <br>
                <strong>Move the arrow keys</strong> to move around the rectangle. If they collide with one another their color will
                change to black, else their color will return back to white.

            <p>
                To implement this is fairly straight-forward, just a single if condition in C++ and it'll work like a charm.

            <p>
                In order to check if two AABBs intersect, we need to preform checks to see if their projections are intersecting
                one another and that's exactly what we're doing in the above code.

                <h3>Circle Vs Circle</h3>
            </header>

            <p>
                Similar to AABB checking for collision between two circles is just as easy as it gets. All we need to
                do is check if the length of a line going from the center of circle to the center of another circle is less 
                than the sum of the two circles' radii, if true they intersect.
