            <p class="info">
                I am a computer engineer student, with a primary intrest in graphics programming and rendering.
                My first graphic releated project was making a simple 2D game engine using SDL2, at first it 
                started as a project idea born out of boredom but I insitantly fell in love with idea of writing 
                code to generate imagery. I started delving more into game engine development and it's many aspects 
                especially creating physics engines which also fell into my intrest bucket and started integrating 
                a "not so accurate but functioning" physics engine to my 2D game engine. You can sort of see now why 
                this website is mainly focused on data structures and algorithms related to game devlopment.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although, Fudge's Tutorials mainly focuses on graphics programming and game development tutorials, 
                I also wrote pages for more general data structures and algoirthms like sorting algorithms and AVL Trees. 
                The reason was I also enjoyed solving comptetive programming problems, so it made sense to include tutorials 
                for that too.
                <br>
                <br>
                I try to make my tutorials as bug free as possible, so if you encounter any please do send me an email with full
                details of what the issue is and the expected results are. I'll try my best to respond to all emails.
